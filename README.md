C programming language was used in this project.  

In our project, we will be implementing a syntax analyzer (parser) for the PPLL programming language.
The main objective of this project is to develop a recursive-descent
parser to analyze the syntax of PPLL programs. By doing so, we can ensure that the programs written 
in PPLL adhere to the specified grammar rules. This parser will be built upon the tokens produced by
the scanner we developed earlier.

You can find more details about input and output types in the report files.
